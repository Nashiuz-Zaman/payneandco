                When booking a holiday most of us choose an ABTA registered
                travel agent. These are professional bodies established to
                maintain standards in their respective industries and protect
                the public from malpractice.

                We are Members of The Association of Residential Letting Agents

                Member firms are kept informed of the ever changing raft of new
                regulations and are required to adhere to a strict code of
                practice.

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                Regrettably membership remains voluntary allowing many agents to
                operate with little knowledge of the law and no insurance. For
                the innocent client, facing prosecution for breaking laws of
                which they were never advised is traumatic whilst litigation is
                pointless if the agent has no insurance and cannot pay.

                ARLA and NAEA both operate bonding schemes insuring all client
                monies held by member firms. In other words, any money we hold
                on behalf of your or your tenant is insured. An annual
                accountant’s undertaking is required to confirm Members “Client
                Bank Accounts” are being correctly administered.

                The legislation may seem daunting but compliance need not be
                expensive. We deal with this every day on every property we let.

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                Rental income is liable to tax whether or not the landlord
                resides in the UK. Tax is levied on rental profit. Mortgage
                interest, agency charges, furniture depreciation, repairs and
                maintenance is all taken into account. Landlords are recommended
                to seek independent tax advice.
              </p>

              <h2 class="two-col-text__heading">Overseas Landlords</h2>

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                Under current legislation, landlords must apply for an exemption
                certificate to be issued to us permitting us to pay the rent to
                you gross. Only the Landlord can make the application which, if
                granted, will be issued directly to the agent. If the property
                is jointly owned and both owners are overseas, then exemption
                certificates are required for both owners. Until an exemption
                certificate is received we are legally required to withhold a
                percentage of the net rental income as a provision against tax.
                Tenants paying rent directly to an overseas landlord should
                still withhold tax. The landlord has a duty of care to make the
                tenant aware of this.
              </p>

              <h2 class="two-col-text__heading">THE DEPOSIT</h2>

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                This is held as security against damage, rent arrears and any
                other breaches of the tenancy agreement. From 6th April 2007 all
                tenants’ deposits held on Assured Shorthold Tenancies
                (commencing after this date) must be protected by one of three
                schemes. Company Lets and other forms of tenancies are exempt.
              </p>

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                Deposits held on tenancies commencing prior to 6th April 2007
                which are allowed to become periodic (roll on without a new
                agreement being drawn up) need not be protected. There are two
                insured schemes where either the agent or the landlord may hold
                the deposit and a Custodial Scheme which is free but the scheme
                holds the deposit.

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                Under The Tenancy Deposit Protection Scheme, tenants must agree

              </p>

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                In the event of a dispute that cannot be resolved (unless the
                disputed sum exceeds £5000) the matter can be referred to a free
                but binding dispute resolution service (or you can still choose
                to go to Court). In any event you will need to provide
                documentary evidence to prove the loss or damage you are
                claiming was caused by the tenant.
              </p>

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                Whilst it is not a legal requirement, if you cannot produce a
                detailed inventory, signed by the tenant at the start of the
                tenancy, together with a signed, and equally meticulous “Check
                In” and “Check Out” report, a case examiner working for any of
                the schemes or a Court of Law, will almost certainly award the
                disputed sum to the tenant.

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                Converted flats or bedsits that SHARE amenities e.g. bathroom,
                kitchen, toilet, i.e. not completely self contained

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                Licensing is required where such properties are occupied by 5 or
                more people(including children) comprising 2 or more households,
                who share amenities i.e. bathroom, kitchen or toilet facilities.
                Further clarification should always be sought directly with the
                local authority as failure to comply can result in a fine of up

                became a legal requirement for residential landlords to ensure

                The landlord must advise their insurers if their property is
                rented as failure to do so may invalidate the policy. As well as
                insuring the property, landlords may also wish to consider
                insuring their own contents and to take out public liability
                cover in case of injury to a tenant in the property. As

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                “Buy to Let” was established to allow private investors to
                acquire properties to let without the need to pay commercial
                rates of interest. Mortgage lenders involved in the “Buy to Let”
                scheme will take into account the level of projected rental
                income likely to be generated from the property.
              </p>

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                Some lenders insist that “Buy to Let” properties are let and
                managed by ARLA agents. We recommend you discuss your proposed
                purchase with us as buying the right property in the right
                location is critical.
              </p>

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                We will be happy to speak to you about any “Buy to Let” ideas

              <h2 class="two-col-text__heading">CHOOSE THE RIGHT AGENT</h2>

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                Inexperienced landlords often assume that the more agents they
                instruct, the more they increase their chances of finding a good
                tenant but choosing the right letting agent is arguably more
                important than choosing the right estate agent.
              </p>

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                When selling, price is generally the critical factor and it
                generally makes little difference to most people who sells it.
                Once the buyer moves in, if they damage the property or miss
                mortgage payments, it’s their property and their problem.
              </p>

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                When letting, you trust complete strangers to look after your
                property and pay the rent. If they damage the property or fail
                to pay the rent, it’s your property, your mortgage and your
                problem.
              </p>

              <p class="two-col-text__paragraph">
                In our view, the more agents you instruct, the greater the
                chance of finding a poor tenant. There is nothing wrong with
                speaking to several agents but only instruct one. A less
                reputable agent may decide not to risk allowing the property to
                be let by a competitor and persuade a client to accept any
                tenant in order to secure their commission.
